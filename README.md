# A Keras Implementation of [Standalone Self-Attention in Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05909.pdf)

The paper was opened in 2019.6, but its official code has not yet been released.
It is an unofficial implementation, and a bug may exist.
I would appreciate it if you could tell me when there is an issue.

## Requirements
* python==3.x 
* tensorflow==1.13.0
* numpy>=1.15.4
* keras== 2.2.4
